# the Roll Of Tape OS

Welcome to the Roll Of Tape OS(ROT for short)! The name came from the fact that the original goal was to create a single file OS, but now I have finally gotten my linker to work and it has become a multi-file OS, written in C and (NASM) assembler.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Simple screen clearing and printing
 * Monochrome and colour text detection

FEATURES THAT WILL COME:

 * Ramdisk-based memory management
 * Emulated program format
 * Disk drivers of some sort
 * Loadable driver support
 * A logfile
 * The ability to veiw individual video buffers
