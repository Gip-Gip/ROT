#The Roll Of Tape OS

The Roll Of Tape OS(ROT for short) is an in-development OS that's intentions
are to be flexible, well documented, and ~~contained within one file~~. This is
my first attempt at an OS and is guaranteed to be sloppy and basic, but thus is
why I have put it on GitHub (so it can be improved)!

#The Idea  
~~ROT got it's name from the fact that it is entirely contained in one file. The
reason for this is mostly due to the license it is under, but I also (for some
reason) believe that it is easier to organize (because linkers are sooo
complicated :P). Luckily for me us there are #ifdef markers to help build
different things by just commenting and uncommenting stuff.. yea.. I'm not
organized at all.

What I'm aiming for when I finish the basic goals and hurtles of developing ROT
is a CP/M inspired OS (interpreted EXEs, multitasking, console based) that is
unbelievably flexible, to the point that if it has a console, ROT will run on it
(I can have dreams, OK).~~

Since I have sortof grown to dispise LASM,  I will instead make sepreate kernels
in assembler that comply to the same things.

#Testing Environments
